# ðŸ§® Asynchronous FIFO Buffer (Verilog)

This project implements an **Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer** in Verilog, designed for robust data transfer between two clock domains â€” commonly used in hardware interfaces like UART, SPI, or DMA buffers.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Dual Clock Domains**  
  Separate `wclk` and `rclk` to support asynchronous data transfer.

- **Gray Code Pointers**  
  Used for reliable synchronization of read and write pointers across clock domains.

- **Status Flags**  
  - `wfull` â€” FIFO is full
  - `rempty` â€” FIFO is empty

- **Parameterizable Depth and Width**  
  Customize FIFO size using parameters.

- **Safe Pointer Synchronization**  
  Two-stage flip-flop synchronizers minimize metastability risk.
